About ScalienDB
***************

ScalienDB is a scalable, replicated key-value database, a product of Scalien, available at http://scalien.com.

ScalienDB is set apart from other key-value databases by its use of immediate consistency through the Paxos algorithm.
This means that no split-brain scenario can occur (like in eventual consistency), where different nodes see different versions of the database.
