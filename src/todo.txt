- go through TODOs
- no underscores in header declarations

+ renamed restartCounter to runID


- one or more PaxosLease instances? - one or more ReplicatedLog instances?
  + we need MANY because of timers
- contextID vs. logID vs. chunkID

- writev vectored write optimalizations

- change * and & to conform to Doom3 standards

- Readf/Writef vs ReadBuffer

- rename QuorumContext => QuorumContext (!)
- PaxosAcceptorState::value should come from a BufferPool (!)
- Paxos value should have a limit of 100K (=object size limit),
  but this should not limit the KV value size
  eg. a large value is typically a list, but only replicate the small mutation ops
  which involve one object at a time


- Paxos - 1
- ReplicatedLog - 1
- ReplicationManager - 1
--------------------------( Framework )
- ReplicatedDB
- HTTP


- when a chunk is taken away from a data node, it needs to shut down that
  QuorumContext/ReplicatedLog, so we'll need a Shutdown() function there
  problem is if there are async (db) operations going on for that chunk

- stremaing ReplicatedLog catchup
